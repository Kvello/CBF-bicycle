# Bicycle Model with Acceleration/Torque Control
## Overview

This project implements a dynamic bicycle model with acceleration and torque control capabilities. The control strategy uses Exponential Control Barrier Functions (ECBF) to ensure safety. The primary goal of this project is to explore and develop ECBFs.
